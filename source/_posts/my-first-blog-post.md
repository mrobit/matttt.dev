There's a point to this thing, I think. Basically, I'm semi-formally researching/attempting to prototype some project management tools that I have wanted to take a crack at for the longest time, but never did because *_reasons_*. Ideally, this blog will be a regular thing I keep up with, and ultimately will keep me accountable to do something that forces me to learn new stuff.

Also if there are either a ton of key repeats or missing letters, it's because Apple's keyboards suck ass.

ANYWAY.

My ultimate goal for a decent project management system is a mash-up between two SaaS apps: Basecamp and Notion.

Basecamp is fine. It's extremely popular, it's stable, but man they are *SLOW* with new feature rollouts.

Recurring tasks. Bulk assigning due dates. Just general productivity things. What the hell. Every request we've submitted has basically fallen on deaf ears, it seems. Their interface, however, is very user friendly and easy for non-technical people to grasp, which is why I assume they've got roughly 4 trillion customers.

Notion is cool. It's great for knowledge base stuff, documentation, blogs (heh) etc. but it doesn't work as a project management system. No notifications, etc.  Plus, it's pretty heavy, in the sense that it's got too much of what we would need in a project management system (at [Anchour](https://www.anchour.com)).

If I could combine those two, with a few extra features sprinkled in, I'd love it. For example, a *GREAT* flow (at least for me) for writing notes and handling action items (tasks, etc) would be something like the following:

Write notes in a meeting, and when it comes time to creating action items, create a new "task" block in the note.  This isn't anything crazy. Just a generic task. Once you save the note, the system rounds up all the tasks that you created in the note so you can easily assign them after the note taking is done, if desired.

More to come. #neat
